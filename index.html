              I was born in Bielefeld, Germany, on the first of June in 1966.
            </p>
            <p>
              As my father happened to be a passionate traveller he took my
              brother, my mother and myself to beautiful and interesting places
              such as Ireland, Malta, the South of France and Switzerland during
              the 1970s and 1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my secondary school years I travelled as an exchange student to
              Angers, France, and to Salisbury, England.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later in life I kept travelling to many places in Europe, to
              cities such as London, Paris, Vienna, Bruxelles, Amsterdam,
              Dublin, Galway, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Brest, Venice, Berlin, to
              Islands such as Malta and Tenerife, and one trip even took me to
              the United States of America, New York, Pennsylvania,
              Wilkes-Barre.
            </p>
            <p>
              Somewhere in between I lived for a couple of years in the
              southeast of Belgium, in the French-speaking region Wallonia, in a
              sound village called Gemmenich.
            </p>
            <p>
              But one country, which my family and I hit in the mid 1970s, left
              a lifelong impression on me: Ireland, and there, the Dingle
              Peninsula. I would return to this country many times throughout my
              adult life. Alone, with my brother, my partners, my son. In 2014 I
              even fulfilled myself a lifelong dream – I moved to the Dingle
              Peninsula and lived there for two years. More than 40 years after
              I came there for the first time as a child, now being in my late
              40s. I have always felt this place being a home to my soul, my
              spirit, my psyche, however you name it, which connects us to a
              place.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2017 I visited Finland for the first time in my life. The
              moment I stepped out of the plane I, uncannily, felt that this was
              the start of another life changing encounter with another country.
              I stayed in the South of Finland for three months, visiting
              Helsinki, Espoo and Kemiönsaari peninsula, and fell in love with
              the Scandinavian nature and the Finnish way of life. A year later
              I travelled to a city in Northern Finland, Oulu, and felt at home
              in this place right away. Here I found the perfect mix of sea,
              lakes, rivers and forests, surrounding the “Capital of Northern
              Scandinavia”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though I now seem to have found a home of the heart,
              travelling is a red thread in my life.

            <p>
              In 1997 I graduated from Aachen University with a degree in Visual
              Communication/Graphic Design and lost myself a little bit in the
              advertisement agency universe for a few years. Being a single
              working mum I needed to put bread and butter to the table. I was
              happy when I was able to swap the junior art director’s job with
              becoming a self-employed editor and layouter of travel guides,
              which I still am to this very day. This also gave me the space to
              rediscover my passion for visual arts and photography, which I
              would never give up again and that would then accompany all my
              travels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many encounters with people with narcissistic personality disorder
              in family, partners and some “friends” and episodes of general
              anxiety disorder led to another red thread in my life - occupying
              myself with the subject of psychology, and there, trauma and
              trauma healing. I have been researching and investigating the
              matter passionately for a good decade now. This also gave me the
              great opportunity to learn a lot about myself, about my own
              psyche.
            </p>
            <p>
              So why not combining the three of them? Photography, travels and
              psychology?
            </p>
            <p>
              My photography is void of people, it solely shows scenes of
              nature. Nature is my healing drug; nature is my home and my
              religion and where I recharge my batteries. My photography shall
              mirror inner landscapes of the psyche, mirror landscape of emotion
              — fear, melancholy, loneliness, or abstracts like hope and loss,
              and conditions of life. Let it speak to you, let it resonate in
              you. We humans are all on a journey, rowing the same boat across
              the same ocean towards the same sunset. What we need is to
              understand each other and ourselves better.

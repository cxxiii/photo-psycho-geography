# Photo·Psycho·Geography

This is a personal/photography website, [katjaschmelzer.de](https://www.katjaschmelzer.de/), I made for a family member. 

For self-educational purposes, I developed it in the style of a single page app, to practice pure JavaScript and DOM manipulation specifically.

Feel free to check out and suggest improvements to the code.
